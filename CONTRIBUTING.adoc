= How to contribute

== Reporting issues

Please state:

 - The contents of your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` project file.
 - Your pre-commit version.
 - Your operating system (including major/minor version if able).
 - Steps that have to be performed in order to reproduce the issue.
 - As much of the relevant console output as you're willing to share (you're, of course, welcome to sanitize out any "private" information such as absolute paths).

== Adding/modifying a hook

- Language: `system` or `python_venv` hooks are preferred, due to ease of maintenance, but if you've written a hook in another language that's on https://pre-commit.com/#supported-languages[pre-commit's supported list], that's fine as well.
- Try to avoid modifying the working copy of files if you can, *especially* in the case of changing already-existent hooks.
- There's no test harness currently, but you're welcome to add one.

== Other changes/additions

Also welcome. Please concisely describe rationale if relevant.
